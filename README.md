Roku is a lightweight text editor, implementing everything you would want from one.
This software is not yet ready for daily use and may contain bugs. If you find some, please report them in the Issues tab.

## Features

- Multiple buffers (open files) support
- Ability to open a shell from inside the editor
- Config file

## Installation

Use the supplied Makefile to compile and install Roku:

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

The default installation path is `/usr/local/bin`. If you want to change that, you can modify the *DEST* variable:

```bash
sudo make install DEST=/path/to/install
```

If you want to uninstall Roku, you can also set a custom *DEST* path. Please note it must be the same path as used to install Roku.

```bash
sudo make uninstall [DEST=/path/to/install]
```
